<p>The most popular and visited castle in Germany is Schloss Neuschwanstein. This castle was created as a palace for King Ludwig II of Bavaria. According to the Bavarian Castle Administration, King Ludwig II was unable to see the finished Neuschwanstein. The construction of the castle lasted for around 25 years. The final towers were completed by 1892 which was after his death in 1888. Neuschwanstein literally translates to "new swan stone." The swan represents purity in Christianity. The castle was originally known as "Neue Burg Hohenschwangau," but following Ludwig's death, it was renamed Neuschwanstein. Wagner, Ludwig II's close personal friend, was honoured throughout the castle. Wagner's impact on the castle is evident, with several paintings inspired by his works adorning the inside of the castle.  With a building cost of 7 million marks, Neuschwanstein Castle was one of Europe's most expensive castles. Neuschwanstein Castle attracts 1.3 million visitors each year.

<p>On September 7, 1949, the German Bundestag held its first constituent meeting in Bonn. Four years after the end of the war and the collapse of the National Socialist government, this signified a fresh beginning in the west of the partitioned country's west.  Since then, the German Bundestag has been at the foundation of the democratic system of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>

<p>Cologne Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral. The cathedral is the world's tallest twin-spired church, as well as Northern Europe's largest Gothic church. In 1248, the 818 Church was destroyed by fire to make way for the new cathedral. Despite being attacked 14 times by aircraft bombs during WWII, the church still remained standing. The cathedral has become a very popular tourist destination in Germany. Visitors climb the 533 stone steps of the spiral staircase which allows them to see a view over the Rhine.
