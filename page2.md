<p>The most popular and visited castle in Germany is Schloss Neuschwanstein. This castle was created as a palace for King Ludwig II of Bavaria. According to the Bavarian Castle Administration, King Ludwig II was unable to see the finished Neuschwanstein. The construction of the castle lasted for around 25 years. The final towers were completed by 1892 which was after his death in 1888. The literal translation of Neuschwanstein is "new swan stone." The swan represents purity in Christianity. The castle was originally known as "Neue Burg Hohenschwangau," but following Ludwig's death, it was renamed Neuschwanstein. Ludwig II is thought to have constructed Neuschwanstein for both political and personal reasons. Wagner, Ludwig II's close personal friend, was honoured throughout the castle. Wagner's impact on the castle is evident, with several paintings inspired by his works adorning the inside of the castle.  With a building cost of 7 million marks, Neuschwanstein Castle is one of Europe's most expensive castles. Marienbrücke, a bridge that hangs over a waterfall, provides one of Neuschwanstein's most famous views, and is one of the most famous attractions. Neuschwanstein Castle attracts 1.3 million visitors each year.

<p>The Reichstag building is one of Berlin's most popular tourist attractions. After Germany's national unification and the founding of the German Reich in 1871, the Reichstag building was completed in 1894. The building's 24 million marks were derived from French war reparations. The Reichstag was extensively destroyed by Allied bombs and fighting after WWII. This also meant that the Reichstag could no longer serve as a seat of government since West Germany's capital had moved to Bonn. In 1955, it was then agreed that the German Bundestag's structure should be restored. The design of the Reichstag building's refurbishment was chosen through an architectural competition. The rebuild, which occurred from 1961 to 1964, was designed by the architect Paul Baumgarten. However. the building was mainly unused after German Reunification in 1990. The Reichstag currently serves as the seat of the German federal parliament.The Reichstag Building's terrace and dome are open to the public and provide stunning views over the parliamentary and government areas as well as Berlin's landmarks.</p>

<p>Cologne Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral. The cathedral is the world's tallest twin-spired church, as well as Northern Europe's largest Gothic church. In 1248, the 818 Church was destroyed by fire to make way for the new cathedral. Despite being attacked 14 times by aircraft bombs during WWII, the church still remained standing. The cathedral has become a very popular tourist destination in Germany. Visitors climb the 533 stone steps of the spiral staircase which allows them to see a view over the Rhine.
