<p>The most popular and visited castle in Germany is Schloss Neuschwanstein. This castle was created as a palace for King Ludwig II of Bavaria. According to the Bavarian Castle Administration, King Ludwig II was unable to see the finished Neuschwanstein. The construction of the castle lasted for around 25 years. The final towers were completed by 1892 which was after his death in 1888. The literal translation of Neuschwanstein is "new swan stone." The swan represents purity in Christianity. The castle was originally known as "Neue Burg Hohenschwangau," but following Ludwig's death, it was renamed Neuschwanstein. Ludwig II is thought to have constructed Neuschwanstein for both political and personal reasons. Wagner, Ludwig II's close personal friend, was honoured throughout the castle. Wagner's impact on the castle is evident, with several paintings inspired by his works adorning the inside of the castle.  With a building cost of 7 million marks, Neuschwanstein Castle is one of Europe's most expensive castles. Marienbrücke, a bridge that hangs over a waterfall, provides one of Neuschwanstein's most famous views, and is one of the most famous attractions. Neuschwanstein Castle attracts 1.3 million visitors each year.</p>

<p>The Reichstag building is one of Berlin's most popular tourist attractions. After Germany's national unification and the founding of the German Reich in 1871, the Reichstag building was completed in 1894. The building's 24 million marks were derived from French war reparations. The Reichstag was extensively destroyed by Allied bombs and fighting after WWII. This also meant that the Reichstag could no longer serve as a seat of government since West Germany's capital had moved to Bonn. In 1955, it was then agreed that the German Bundestag's structure should be restored. The design of the Reichstag building's refurbishment was chosen through an architectural competition. The rebuild, which occurred from 1961 to 1964, was designed by the architect Paul Baumgarten. However. the building was mainly unused after German Reunification in 1990. The Reichstag currently serves as the seat of the German federal parliament.The Reichstag Building's terrace and dome are open to the public and provide stunning views over the parliamentary and government areas as well as Berlin's landmarks.</p>

<p>Cologne Cathedral, also known as Kölner Do, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Cologne, Germany. The cathedral is the world's tallest twin-spired church, as well as Northern Europe's largest Gothic church. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 and is a well-known landmark of German Catholicism and Gothic architecture. Master Gerhard of Reil designed the Gothic Cathedral's architectural plan, which was based on the cathedrals of Paris, Strasbourg, and Amiens. The construction of this Gothic monument, began in 1248 and was not completed until 1880. In August 1880, 632 years after the work had began, the cathedral's completion was commemorated as a national event. Despite being struck 14 times by aircraft bombs during WWII, the church still remained standing. However, the restoration of this damage took a long time. The interior of the Cathedral is the third-largest in the world. The cathedral has become a very popular tourist destination in Germany. Visitors are able to climb the 533 stone steps of the spiral staircase which allows them to see a view over the Rhine.

<p>The medieval Römer building is a significant part of the Römerplatz (Römer Square) in Frankfurt's Altstadt and is one of the city's most famous buildings. The Römer's initial building dates back to the 15th century. Many changes have been made to the original design over the years. The latest extension to the original structure was completed in 1908. The Kaisersaal, also known as the Emperor's Hall, was where grand coronation feasts were held and where Napoleon, Russian Czars, and other royals paid visits. During World War II, much of Römerberg center and the Römer buildings were destroyed, but what was left was quickly rebuilt. The Römerhalle and Schwanenhalle, located below ground level, were spared from the bombs and have now become tourist attractions and venues for private and public events. The wedding halls are located on the first and second levels of the Römer. The main building also also serves as a standesamt (civil registration office).
