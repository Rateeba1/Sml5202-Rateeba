<p> The Oktoberfest is a Bavarian cultured festival in Germany which has grown into a global event. It begins at the end of September and runs until the first Sunday of October. It takes place every year outside of Munich's city centre. The festival takes place on the Theresienwiese. On the opening weekend, costumed artists and musicians stroll through the center of Munich to celebrate the start of the Oktoberfest. Another common tradition of the festival is a colourful parade through Munich.
